# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects

Welcome to my **EDA Projects Repository**!  
This repository contains multiple data analysis projects where I deeply explore different datasets using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.

Each project includes:
- A dataset (`.csv`)  
- A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)  
- A project-level README (inside each folder)  
- Insights and visualizations

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

The goal of these EDA projects is to:

- Understand datasets deeply  
- Detect missing values, outliers, and data quality issues  
- Analyze patterns, trends, and relationships  
- Visualize important insights  
- Prepare data for machine learning  

These projects demonstrate my **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization skills**, which are essential for a Data Analyst / Data Scientist.
