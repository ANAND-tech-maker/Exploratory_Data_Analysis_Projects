# 📊 Superstore Sales Analysis (EDA Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a Superstore Sales dataset.  
The goal is to understand sales patterns, profit distribution, product performance, and regional trends.

This analysis helps identify:
- Which categories generate the most sales  
- Which regions perform better  
- How discount affects profit  
- Sub-category level performance  
- Trends in sales over time
