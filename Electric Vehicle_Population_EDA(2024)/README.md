# Electric Vehicle (EV) Population Analysis

## About the Project
This project explores the **Electric Vehicle (EV) population across US counties and states**. Using **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**, it visualizes the distribution, trends, and adoption percentage of EVs. The analysis helps identify **top counties, state-wise EV penetration, and comparisons between BEVs and PHEVs**.

## Dataset
- Contains information about **battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), total EVs, non-electric vehicles, and EV percentages** per county and state.
- Data Source: [Your dataset source link]

## Purpose
- Understand **EV adoption patterns** across regions.
- Identify **top-performing counties and states**.
- Visualize **BEV vs PHEV trends** and **EV penetration percentages**.
- Provide insights for **policy-making or market analysis**.

## Key Visualizations
- **Bar plots**: Top counties by total EVs  
- **Histograms & KDE plots**: Distribution of EVs and EV percentage  
- **Scatter plots**: Relationship between EV_Total, Percent_EV, BEVs, and PHEVs  
- **State-wise Choropleth map**: Visualize EV penetration (%) across US states  

## Conclusion
- King County has the highest number of EVs.  
- BEVs dominate over PHEVs in most counties.  
- California, Washington, and Texas lead in EV penetration percentages.  
- EV adoption correlates with total vehicle count but varies by region.

## Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
